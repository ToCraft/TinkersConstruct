    { "text": "Armor is crafted in the Crafting Station instead of the Tinker Station or Anvil. Armor have varying number of upgrade, defense, and ability slots based on the type; some types even have material traits. Unlike tools, holding the armor typically provides no effect; most modifiers require wearing the armor to be applicable." }
